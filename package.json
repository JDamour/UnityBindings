  "description": "This is a library of binding components that allow you to quickly wire data sources to target properties via the inspector.  \n  \nBinding changes propagate via the System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged interface but the included binding components will also refresh their target properties in OnEnable.  \nA general purpose ComponentBinding monobehaviour is included to wire any two UnityEngine.Objects together as well as a TextBinding for quick and simple binding to text fields.\r\n",
